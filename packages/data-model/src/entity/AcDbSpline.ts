/**
 * Represents a spline entity in AutoCAD.
 *
 * A spline is a 3D geometric object defined by control points or fit points.
 * Splines are smooth curves that can be used to create complex curved shapes
 * in drawings. They can be either open or closed curves.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create a spline from control points
 * const controlPoints = [
 *   new AcGePoint3d(0, 0, 0),
 *   new AcGePoint3d(5, 5, 0),
 *   new AcGePoint3d(10, 0, 0)
 * ];
 * const knots = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1];
 * const spline = new AcDbSpline(controlPoints, knots);
 *
 * // Create a spline from fit points
 * const fitPoints = [
 *   new AcGePoint3d(0, 0, 0),
 *   new AcGePoint3d(5, 5, 0),
 *   new AcGePoint3d(10, 0, 0)
 * ];
 * const spline2 = new AcDbSpline(fitPoints, AcGeKnotParameterizationType.Uniform);
 * ```
