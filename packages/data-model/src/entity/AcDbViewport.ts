/**
 * Represents a viewport entity in AutoCAD drawings.
 *
 * A viewport is a rectangular window that displays a portion of the drawing model space
 * within paper space layouts. Viewports allow users to create multiple views of the same
 * drawing at different scales and orientations on a single sheet.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Viewports exist primarily in paper space layouts
 * - Each viewport has a unique ID number (except the default system viewport with ID 1)
 * - Viewports can be active or inactive
 * - The viewport entity itself is drawn as a rectangular border in paper space
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const viewport = new AcDbViewport();
 * viewport.centerPoint = new AcGePoint3d(0, 0, 0);
 * viewport.width = 10;
 * viewport.height = 8;
 * viewport.number = 2;
 * ```
